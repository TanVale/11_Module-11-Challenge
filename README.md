# Module-11-Challenge

In this challenge I have done some web-scraping and created a data analyis project. 
I extracted the information on a web page by identifying the HTML elements and created two files 
1. I extract the titles and preview text of the news articles that I scraped. I then stored the scraping results in a Python dictionary and, gave each dictionary two keys: title and preview. 
Print the list in your notebook.
2. I assembled the scraped data in a Pandas DataFrame. I then analyzed the dataset using Pandas functions to answer the questions of the assignment -
      How many months exist on Mars?
      How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
      What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:
      Find the average minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
      Plot the results as a bar chart.
      Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:
      Find the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
      Plot the results as a bar chart.
      About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
      Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
      Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
